# Resolve RPC For Discord

---

## This open-source program detects when you are running both Discord and DaVinci Resolve, and it adds the app to the "Playing" section, similar to how Adobe and their programs have it.

---

To download, double click the .exe that you installed from the Releases tab on Github. Now press âŠž + R , and type "shell:startup:. Move that file to inside that folder. Restart your PC. Now, it should detect when both apps are running and add an RPC to your account!
